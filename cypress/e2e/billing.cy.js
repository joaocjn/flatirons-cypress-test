// Note:
// This test focuses only on validating the plan change functionality,
// and intentionally does not test the checkout form again.
// The checkout modal only appears the first time a credit card is added.
// Since the card remains saved after the first subscription,
// the checkout UI cannot be consistently revalidated on repeated runs.
//
// To test the Stripe checkout form every time, one would need to create
// a new user account on each run. However, this would make the test brittle
// and dependent on multiple chained steps (account creation, email confirmation, etc).
// That approach violates good E2E testing practices â€” tests must be
// deterministic, isolated, and not rely on prior tests or data.
//
// A better long-term solution would be for the test environment to provide
// a way to reset the user's account state, including subscription status
// and stored payment methods. That would enable complete and repeatable
// testing of the checkout experience without coupling tests.
//
// For that reason, this test assumes the card is already stored
// and focuses on verifying that the user can successfully upgrade the plan.
